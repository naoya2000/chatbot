# About the tool

I envision creating a crisis mental health solution that enables the user to speak to a responder with assurance about privacy and security. As it currently stands, the tool hasn't yet been completely built, but I am working at it in phases.

The (tentative) final product will be a real-time chat app that people experiencing mental health crises can use to speak to a responder. What I see as the distinguishing factor from current solutions is our approach to user safety, confidentiality and information security. Many existing solutions have a policy of reporting to law enforcement agencies or medical institutions in the case where the responder believes that there is a concern with the caller. In addition, I know of no solution that incorporates end-to-end encryption. We aim to create a solution where user information is totally confidential, unless the user explicitly agrees to the sharing of their information with external parties. We also plan to implement end-to-end encryption so that the only people who can see the conversation are the user and the responder.

The pages/interfaces that the user will go through:
1. scroller_welcome.html ( https://github.com/naoya2000/chatbot/blob/main/scroller_welcome.html )
2. index.html ( https://github.com/naoya2000/chatbot/blob/main/main/server/index.html )
3. feedback screen (not developed at the time of writing)

I look forward to seeing how this will progress.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
